# Windows 10 IoT Enterprise release information

Beginning with Windows 10 IoT Enterprise, version 21H2, feature updates for Windows 10 release are released annually, in the second half of the calendar year, to the General Availability Channel. They will be serviced with monthly quality updates for 30 months from the date of the release, depending on the lifecycle policy.

We recommend that organizations begin deployment of each General Availability Channel release immediately as a targeted deployment to devices selected for early adoption and ramp up to full deployment at your discretion. This will enable you to gain access to new features, experiences, and integrated security as soon as possible.

For information about servicing timelines, see the [Windows lifecycle FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13853).

>[!NOTE]
> The General Availability Channel replaces the previous “Semi-Annual Channel” as the primary and recommended channel for Windows 10 IoT Enterprise servicing.
