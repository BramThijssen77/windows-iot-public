# Windows IoT Enterprise Release History

The Windows IoT Enterprise product line is intended for special-purpose devices typically found in industries including, but not limited to, banking, healthcare, hospitality, manufacturing, and retail.   Windows IoT Enterprise is a derivative of Windows Enterprise and as such includes advanced security, management and lockdown capabilities required to support special-purpose devices in an enterprise environment.  

There are currently three products offerings in the Windows IoT Enterprise product line each of which contain multiple releases. For more information, see...

* [Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC](#windows-iot-enterprise-ltsc)
* [Windows 10 IoT Enterprise](#windows-10-iot-enterprise)
* [Windows 11 IoT Enterprise](#windows-11-iot-enterprise)

Each of the Windows IoT Enterprise product offerings is available for device makers through an authorized [Windows IoT Distributor](https://aka.ms/IoTDistributorList) for building new devices.  To learn more about licensing Windows IoT Enterprise, see [Licensing and Usage](/windows/iot/iot-enterprise/commercialization/licensing).

## Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC

Windows IoT Enterprise is available through the Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) to provide a 10-year support lifecycle for special-purpose devices where changes in functionality aren't desirable. New LTSC releases are typically provided on a three year cadence, but timing can vary from one release to the next. We communicate variances in this cadence as early as possible. For more information, see [Windows as a service - Long-Term Servicing Channel](/windows/deployment/update/waas-overview#long-term-servicing-channel).

Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC releases follow the [Fixed Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/fixed) where each release is supported for 10 years and requires a separate license.
