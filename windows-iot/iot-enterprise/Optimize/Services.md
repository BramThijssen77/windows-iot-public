# Guidance on disabling system services on Windows IoT Enterprise

**Applies to:**

Applies to:  
âœ… Windows 11 IoT Enterprise
âœ… Windows 10 IoT Enterprise
âœ… Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2021

The Windows operating system includes many system services that provide important functionality. Different services have different default start policies: some are started by default (automatic), some when needed (manual), and some are disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled before they can run. These defaults were chosen carefully for each service to balance performance, functionality, and security for typical customers.

However, some IoT customers prefer a more security-focused balance for their Windows IoT devices, one that reduces their attack surface to the absolute minimum, and may therefore wish to fully disable all services that aren't needed in their specific environments. For those customers, Microsoft&reg; is providing the accompanying guidance regarding which services can safely be disabled for this purpose.

Customers can configure their Windows IoT devices to disable selected services using the Security Templates in their Group Policies or using PowerShell automation. In some cases, the guidance includes specific Group Policy settings that disable the service's functionality directly, as an alternative to disabling the service itself.

For more information, see [Using PowerShell to Manage Services](/powershell/scripting/samples/managing-services).

Microsoft recommends that customers disable the following services and their respective scheduled tasks on Windows IoT Enterprise:

Services:

1. Xbox Live Auth Manager
2. Xbox Live Game Save

Scheduled tasks:

1. \Microsoft\XblGameSave\XblGameSaveTask
2. \Microsoft\XblGameSave\XblGameSaveTaskLogon

## Guidance descriptions

For all system services listed in this document, Microsoft provides guidance for enabling and disabling system services in Windows IoT Enterprise.

- **ðŸŸ¡ No guidance:** The effect of disabling these services hasn't been fully evaluated. Therefore, the default configuration of these services shouldn't be changed.
- **â›” Do not disable:** Disabling this service impacts essential functionality by preventing specific roles and features from functioning correctly. Therefore it shouldn't be disabled.
- **ðŸŸ¢ OK to disable:** This service provides functionality that is useful to some but not all enterprises, and security-focused enterprises that don't use it can safely disable it.
- **âœ…&nbsp;Already&nbsp;disabled:** This service is disabled by default; no need to enforce with policy.
- **ðŸ”µ&nbsp;Should&nbsp;be&nbsp;disabled:** This service should never be enabled on a well-managed enterprise system.

## User Services

The following table lists per-user services in the current version of Windows. Other versions of Windows 10/11 might not have the same services available.

Before you reconfigure any of these services, review this information to understand the implications. For example, if you disable the per-user service, there might be dependent apps that don't work correctly. For more information, see [Per User Services in Windows](/windows/application-management/per-user-services-in-windows)
