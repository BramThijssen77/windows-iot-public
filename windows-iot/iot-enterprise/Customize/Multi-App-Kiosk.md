# Assigned access multi-app kiosk
An assigned access multi-app kiosk runs one or more apps from the desktop. People using the kiosk see a customized Start that shows only the tiles for the apps that are allowed. With this approach, you can configure a locked-down experience for different account types. A multi-app kiosk is appropriate for devices that are shared by multiple people. Here's a [guide](/windows/configuration/lock-down-windows-10-to-specific-apps) on how to set up a multi-app kiosk.

>[!NOTE]
>
> Assigned access multi-app kiosk will not be available in the [initial release](/lifecycle/products/windows-11-iot-enterprise-version-21h2) of Windows 11 IoT Enterprise. See [What's new in Windows 11 IoT Enterprise](/windows/iot/product-family/what's-new-in-windows-11-iot-enterprise) for more information.

## Benefits of using a multi-app kiosk
The benefit of a kiosk that runs only one or more specified apps is to provide an easy-to-understand experience for individuals by putting in front of them only the things they need to use, and removing from their view the things they donâ€™t need to access.

A multi-app kiosk is appropriate for devices that are shared by multiple people. Each user can authenticate with the device and receive a customized lockdown experience based on the configuration.

## Configuring your multi-app kiosk
* [Configure a kiosk in Microsoft Intune](/windows/configuration/lock-down-windows-10-to-specific-apps#configure-a-kiosk-in-microsoft-intune)
* [Configure a kiosk using a provisioning package](/windows/configuration/lock-down-windows-10-to-specific-apps#configure-a-kiosk-using-a-provisioning-package)

> [!NOTE]
>
> When you configure a multi-app kiosk, [specific policies](/windows/configuration/kiosk-policies) are enforced that will affect all non-administrator users on the device.
