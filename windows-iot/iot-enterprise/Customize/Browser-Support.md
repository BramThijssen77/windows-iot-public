# Browser Support

Today, you can use two browsers, Internet Explorer 11 and [Microsoft Edge](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-configure-kiosk-mode) to create an assigned access single-app or multi-app kiosk experience.

## Microsoft Edge Kiosk Mode

> Available for LTSC starting in [Windows 10 IoT Enterprise 2021 LTSC](/windows/iot/product-family/what's-new-in-windows-10-iot-enterprise-21h2)

[Microsoft Edge kiosk mode](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-configure-kiosk-mode) offers two lockdown experiences of the browser so organizations can create, manage, and provide the best experience for their customers. The following lockdown experiences are available:

* Digital/Interactive Signage experience - Displays a specific site in full-screen mode.
* Public-Browsing experience - Runs a limited multi-tab version of Microsoft Edge.

Both experiences are running a Microsoft Edge InPrivate session, which protects user data.

## Internet Explorer 11

[Internet Explorer 11](/internet-explorer/internet-explorer) will be considered a legacy browser, in subsequent releases.

In anticipation of that, you can use [Internet Explorer (IE) mode](/deployedge/edge-ie-mode) on Microsoft Edge. IE mode allows you to run legacy web apps as well as modern web apps in a single browser.

> [!NOTE]
> For in-support Windows 10 IoT Enterprise [Semi-Annual Channel (SAC) releases](/lifecycle/products/windows-10-iot-enterprise), Internet Explorer 11 will reach end of support on June 15, 2022.
>
> Internet Explorer 11 follows the Long-Term-Servicing-Channel (LTSC) Lifecycle for [LTSC SKUs](/windows/iot/product-family/product-lifecycle?tabs=2021).
